A hotel management system is a software application that helps hoteliers manage all aspects of their business, from room bookings to customer service. These systems can be used by hotels of all sizes, from small bed-and-breakfasts to large resorts.
Hotel management systems typically offer a variety of features, including:
•	Room booking and reservation management
•	Guest check-in and check-out
•	Room service management
•	Payment Information
•	Food and beverage management
•	Accounting and reporting
Hotel management systems can save hotels time and money by automating many of the tasks that are involved in running a hotel. They can also improve customer service by providing guests with a more convenient and efficient way to book rooms, make reservations, and request services.
